# GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL


A generative text model is a machine learning model designed to produce new text that resembles human-written content. 
It learns patterns and relationships from a large dataset of text and uses that knowledge to generate novel text based on a given input, such as a prompt or a keyword.
These models often employ deep learning techniques, like neural networks, to analyze and understand the structure of language.
